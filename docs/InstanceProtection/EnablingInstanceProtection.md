# Enabling Instance Protection

Instance Protection service can be enabled in two ways.

**During Instance Creation**

1. Follow the steps to create a [Linux](/docs/Compute/LinuxInstances/CreatingLinuxInstances) or a [Windows](/docs/Compute/WindowsInstances/CreatingWindowsInstances) instance.
2. You have to enable the **Protect this Instance** switch. There, you will get a **Standard Protection Service**, and you can also opt for **Advance Protection Features**. 
3. The pricing summary will be reflected as per the selection.

**After Instance Creation**

If you did not enable the protection service while creating the instance, follow these steps to activate it:

1. Go to the **Linux/Windows Instances** section and click on the specific instance. Then, navigate to the **Protection** section and click the **ENABLE PROTECTION** button.
2. To enable advanced protection features, toggle the switch to enable them and Click **Confirm**.
3. After confirming, a list of activation steps will appear. These steps should be executed via the command line. Once completed, the instance will be protected, and its details will be available in the **Instance Protection** menu.
