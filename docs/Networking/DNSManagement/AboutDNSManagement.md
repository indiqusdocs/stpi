# About DNS Management

Ananta servers can be used as authoritative name server(s) for managing DNS records. If the Service is enabled, Cloud Console users can bring their own domains (BYOD) to use with the workloads created using Ananta-powered clouds.

The following sections outline how to use this service:

- [Bringing your domains to Ananta CloudConsole](LinkingDomainstoAnantaCloudConsole)
- [Managing DNS records using Ananta Cloud Console](ManagingDNSRecords)
- [Switching (back) to another DNS provider](SwitchingtoAnotherDNSProvider)
