# Adding Instances to a VFI-based Network

Instances can be created and placed using the Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) Network. These Instances use special Linux OS images, which will be available as a separate OS Collection. Users can go to the usual Instance creation workflow and choose the appropriate options/controls to create an Instance in the Virtual Firewall network. 

See [Creating Linux Instance](/docs/Compute/LinuxInstances/CreatingLinuxInstances) for details.

:::note
In its current scope, VFI-based networks only support a single VLAN/subnet and only special Linux Instances can be added to them.
