# Adding Instances to a Virtual-Firewall-Based Network

Instances can be created and placed using the virtual firewall. These Instances use special Linux OS images, which will be available as a separate OS Collection. Users can go to the usual Instance creation workflow and choose the appropriate options/controls to create an Instance in the Virtual Firewall network. 

See [Creating Linux Instance](/docs/Compute/LinuxInstances/CreatingLinuxInstances) for details.
