    "description": "Ananta supports the delivery and management of Virtual Firewall Instances (VFI) in an as-a-service model. VFI is essentially a Linux Instance pre-loaded with a firewall software which makes it work as a a virtual appliance. The Service falls under the Virtual Firewall section and is built using our integration framework using pfSense or FortiGate for powering the appliance. Cloud Console users can use VFI as an alternative to VR-based VPC which allows users to achieve stronger security and firewalling capabilities. The VFI Service uses L2 networks, which can help in conserving IPv4 addresses.
