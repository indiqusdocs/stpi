# About Load Balancer Instances

The Ananta Load Balancer Instances (LBI) Service allows Cloud Console users to create load balancer appliances, which are Linux Instances pre-loaded with a [Citrix NetScaler VPX](https://www.netscaler.com/platform/vpx-virtual-machine) image. LBI can be used with VPC networks to achieve various traffic management features that are not possible using the standard VPC-based load balancing.

The following management features are supported on Ananta CloudConsole:

- [Creating Load Balancer Instance inside a VPC](CreatingaLoadBalancerInstance)
- [Activating the NetScaler VPX Control Panel](ActivatingtheNetScalerVPX)

:::note
Ananta LBI is an experimental feature.
