# About L2 Networks

L2 networks, often called data link layer networks, play a crucial role in computer networking by establishing direct connections between devices in a local network and ensuring data packets are delivered accurately to their intended destination.

To manage an L2 network, navigate to **Networking > L2 Networks**. 

The following screen appears where all the L2 networks are listed. 

Click on the icons at the end of each network for the following operations:
