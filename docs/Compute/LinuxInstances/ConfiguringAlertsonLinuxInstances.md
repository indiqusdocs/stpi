# Configuring Alerts on Linux Instances

From [Operating Linux Instances](AboutLinuxInstances.md), navigate into a Linux Instance and access the **Alerts** tab to view the configured alerts or configure new ones.

Alerts get triggered whenever a configured condition is met. You can create multiple alerts on an instance. Alerts are sent to recipients that you can define and manage.

You can configure alerts for instances running on the Ananta. You can define alerts for Instances and configure the email recipients for these alerts using a straightforward and easy-to-use interface.

## Instance Alerts

The Alerts tab lists all the alerts already configured for that particular Linux Instance. In addition, it will show the following details:
- ID
- Name for the alert
- Parameter
- Trigger When
- Value
- Reading Duration
