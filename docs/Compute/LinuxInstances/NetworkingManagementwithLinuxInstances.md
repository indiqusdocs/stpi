The following actions are available:

- If the Instance is inside a VPC, you can associate the Instance to multiple tiers within the VPC or share the Instance with other VPC networks in the same Availability Zone by using the **ADD NETWORK** option.
- Network/tier associations can be removed from this section by using the **_unlink_** action.

:::note
Advanced networking configurations can be done using the [Virtual Private Clouds](/docs/Networking/VirtualPrivateClouds/AboutVirtualPrivateClouds) service.
