# Networking Management with Linux Instances

To view the Networks associated with Linux Instance, navigate to a **Linux Instance** and access the **Networking** tab.

The Networking and NICs section list all the networks that a Linux Instance is attached to.

The following actions are available:

- If the Instance is inside a VPC, you can associate the Instance to multiple tiers within the VPC or share the Instance with other VPC networks in the same Availability Zone by using the **ADD NETWORK** option.
- Network/tier associations can be removed from this section by using the **_unlink_** action.
- If the Instance is in a Basic/Flat Networking Availability Zone, you will see the NIC details. Presently, only one NIC is supported on Basic/Flat Networking Instances.

:::note
Advanced networking configurations can be done using the [Virtual Private Clouds](/docs/Networking/VirtualPrivateClouds/AboutVirtualPrivateClouds) service.
