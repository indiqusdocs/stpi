# About Linux Instances

Instances are computing units that provide you with resources to run your applications/workloads. Linux Instances are virtual machines that run the images of Linux Operating Systems, for example, Ubuntu, CentOS, Rocky, Oracle, Debian, etc.

Before creating a Linux instance, it is important to plan the architecture, networking and access to the Linux Instances. 

Ananta offers a highly usable and visual way of working with and operating Linux Instances using the CloudConsole. You can access all the Linux Instances available in your account in the following way:

1. Navigate to **Compute > Linux Instances**.
2. All the Linux instances for your account are listed here with the following details:
	- Instance Name and the configuration details
	- OS Icon
	- Default IP Address
	- Created

- Configuration
- Availability Zone
- Default IP
- Created 

On the top right corner, two quick options are available, one to **LAUNCH CONSOLE** and the other to **POWER OFF/ON** the Instance.

Details on available Linux Instance operations and actions can be found in their respective sections.
